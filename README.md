-Project Description:
The purpose of this project is conducting market research to investigate how the entry of Chobani in 2007 influenced the following sales of Yoplait yoghurt company in yogurt industry. We have national-level weekly data on (1) total unit sales of Yoplait products, (2) average unit price of Yoplait products, (3) average unit price of Dannon products,which is a substitute for Yoplait yoghurt, and (4) average unit price of Chobani products between 2001 and 2011. Our analysis includes firstly plotting the data to observe overall patterns for these three companies in yogurt industry. We also estimate a linear demand curve for Yoplait considering the seasonality,the price of its substitution and time series. The estimated curve will help us interpret the significant factors that affect the sales of Yoplait. Finally, we compute weekly price elasticities of Yoplait demand (own- and two cross-price elasticities) to draw inference about competitive structure, particularly whether the price elasticities changed as a result of Chobani’s entry to reflect market variability.
